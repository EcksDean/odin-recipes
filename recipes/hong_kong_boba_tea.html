    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Hong Kong Milk Tea</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 black tea bags</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sweetened condesnsed milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup ice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tapioca Pearls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup tapioca balls</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Steep tea bags in 1 cup of hot water for 5 minutes.</strong> Set the temperature to 195 F if you're using an electric kettle with a temperature setting. Use filtered water if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Discard tea bags and stir in sweetened condensed milk.</strong> Stir the sweetened condensed milk until it dissolves into the tea. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Boil ¾ cup of water and brown sugar in a saucepan.</strong> Add tapioca balls. Combine water and brown sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Once you see big bubbles (2-4 minutes), add tapioca balls. Keep boiling for 8 more minutes on medium-high heat. Cool slightly, until tapioca balls aren't too hot to eat. They should still be pretty warm.</li>
        <li><strong>Put warm tapioca balls in brown sugar syrup into a cup.</strong> Add ice, then the cooled down sweetened tea. Serve immediately and stir before drinking. Use an extra wide straw to drink.</li>
    </ol>
